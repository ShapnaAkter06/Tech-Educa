- <p>I've created this project based on learning web development</p>
- <p>To build in single application page i've installed react router dom</p>
- <p>To design and responsive my website I've used Tailwind CSS, daisyUI and MambaUI which is quicker to write and to maintain my code.</p>
- <p>In my project there is a courses section in the navbar. Courses section is divided into two parts. In the sideBar I've used data-aos for sliding</p>
- <p>To see the course details clicked a button. It will take you to the course details page</p>
- <p>In the course details page there is a download icon in the right side at top. To download the pdf file click on the download button in the right side at the top. And to see the checkout page click on the Get premium Access button in the right side at the bottom.
